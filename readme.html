**Gradebook DSL**

Domain: Teachers managing a csv gradebook<br>
Problem: This language is meant to enable educators to perform manipulations on a gradebook, such as getting the highest / lowest grade, an average
for an assignment, or even curving a grade or applying a new weighting system.<br>

Variable Types and Declarations
===============
file: a CSV file that has been read in as a subset of all the data<br>
col: Group of rows that point to individual cells<br>
row: group of cols that point to individual cells<br>
subset: a group of rows, columns, or even individual cells, represented as a 2d array with enumerable rows/cols<br>
cell: an object that contains its rowHeader, colHeader and value

Script Overview
===============
Input
----------------
Given a csv file, the language will convert it to a subset variable with the column headers and rows as their respective objects.

**Invalid characters**: If a column header contains invalid characters, such as '&'' or '$', they will be removed from the column reference.
Spaces in column headers will be replaced with underscores.

**Conflicting names**: If 2 columns contain the same name, the second one will have the number 1 appended to the end, and the next 2, and so on.
If a column and row share the same name, '_col' will be appended to the column version, and '_row' to the row version.

Actions
---------------
Actions consist of the bulk of the script. New subsets can be defined, conditional statements and loops can provide manipulations to data, and
weight systems aka schemes, can be declared
